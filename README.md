# Solidity Examples

### This Example is a Work in Progress

For now, it contains examples on:
* Creating a smart contract written in Solidity
* Creating tests for the contract using mocha testing suite.
* Deploying the contract in a local test network using the Ganache module.
* [Work in progress] Deploying the contract in the Rigby test network using the Infura API.

This project uses the [Infura API](https://infura.io). You will have to register, create a project, and obtain a valid API key in order to run the examples.
